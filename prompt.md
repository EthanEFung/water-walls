This is one variation of a commonly-asked interview problem.

Before diving into the specification, note a couple of logistical details.
Time limit

End of day (5pm PST).
Day 1 of a two-day problem

Today, you're going to write and verify pure JavaScript logic to solve this problem.

Tomorrow, you're going to wrap that logic inside a mini-app with a frontend and a backend, with more specification.
Specification for part 1

We are going to represent a series of walls of different integer heights.

Given heights of [5, 3, 7, 2, 6, 4, 5, 9, 1, 2], it would look like this:

Now imagine that it rains.

Your goal is to determine which two walls have the most water trapped between them, and exactly how much water that is.

Output for the above: [3, 8, 11]. I.e., between wall #3 and wall #8, there are 11 blocks of water.
Today's deliverable

The goal for today is a Github repo containing:

    a README containing your setup notes (just like the standalone single-function problems).
    a clean JavaScript logic implementation.
    Jest tests thoroughly verifying this logic
